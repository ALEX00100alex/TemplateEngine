# TemplateEngine
A software engineering team generator command line application

# Background 

This is my first attempt at building webpage that displays a team's basic info in node.js

## Functionality

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN user is prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN user clicks on an email address in the HTML
THEN q default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN user clicks on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN user starts the application
THEN they are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN user enters the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN they are presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN user selects the engineer option
THEN they are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN user selects the intern option
THEN they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN user decides to finish building my team
THEN they exit the application, and the HTML is generated
